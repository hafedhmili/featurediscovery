The directory data contains two subdirectories:
- input projects:
Contains the five software packages tested (FreeMind0.7.1, javawebmail-0.7, JHotDraw5.2, JReversePro, and Lucene1.4)
- output:
Contains the output produced by the different algorithms, one directory per algorithm. For algorithms 1 and 2, the structure is self explanatory. For algorithm 3, we distinguish between the raw output (raw-output), which is produced directly by the method FeatureExtractionAction.run(IAction), and interpreted-output, which provides a more detailed analysis of the AD-HOC nodes for three projects out of five representing the most mature (JHotDraw), the least mature (JReversePro) and “middle of the road” (Freemind). The file for JHotDraw contains more data  where we compare the outputs of the three algorithms

The file “appendices” contains a textual, case by case analysis of the AD-HOC nodes for JHotDraw (appendix A) and JReversePro (appendix B). It contains in a more digestible format some of the data in the spreadsheets found data/output/algorithm3/interpreted-output
